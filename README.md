# VBA-challenge

Disclaimer:
In addition to my own code, I used credit_card_challenge.vbs,
wells_fargo_ptl.vbs, and lotto_numbers.vbs as a guide for
the vba script VBAStocks

Note:
The vba script is written to run on the workbook as is. 
I did not sort the data and assumed the data is sorted
in a particular way.
