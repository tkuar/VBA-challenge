# VBA-challenge

Disclaimer:
In addition to my own code, I used credit_card_challenge.vbs,
wells_fargo_ptl.vbs, and lotto_numbers.vbs as a guide for
the vba script VBAStocks

Note:
I manually sorted the data in the excel workbooks
for each worksheet before I ran my vba script.
  First, I sorted column B from smallest to largest.
  Then, I sorted column A from A to Z.
